# ERC20-Token-Distribution-Avalanch.
This analysis dives into how ERC20 tokens are spread out on Avalanche blockchain network. By exploring key attributes such as holders count, total supply, and decimals, the analysis provides valuable insights into the ecosystem's dynamics and user engagement. The project includes fetching ERC20 token data from the Avalanche network, cleaning the data, conducting statistical analysis, and creating advanced visualizations to present the data insightfully.

**Key Features:**
- Fetch ERC20 token data from the Avalanche network using Python.
- Clean the data and prepare it for analysis.
- Analyze the correlation between token attributes using statistical tests.
- Identify outliers and analyze token distribution patterns.
- Create advanced visualizations, including heatmaps and network graphs, to present the data.

**Why This Matters:**
- Gain insights into the health and activity levels of the Avalanche token ecosystem.
- Provide investment insights for diversifying cryptocurrency portfolios.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of token distribution strategies.
- Enhance community engagement and project success.

**How to Use:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (Python, requests, pandas, matplotlib).
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks to fetch data, clean it, and perform analysis.
4. Explore the findings and visualize the data using the provided code.

**Future Work:**
- Expand the analysis to include more ERC20 tokens and analyze trends over time.
- Incorporate machine learning models to predict token distribution patterns.
- Collaborate with other researchers to further explore the dynamics of the Avalanche token ecosystem.
